React has a pretty steep learning curve because of all its dependencies and configurations. Luckily, the developers over at Facebook put together [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to make our lives easier.

And that's everything! You now have your own functional React boilerplate made from scratch. Feel free to check out this project on [Github](https://github.com/Alec1017/react-starter-code) as well.
