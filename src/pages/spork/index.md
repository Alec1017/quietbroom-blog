intro: "An EVM-compatible network forking tool for UI/UX testing "
---

Spork is an Ethereum network forking tool, built on top of Hardhat. It allows for forking of EVM-compatible chains and has CLI commands for funding account addresses with both ERC20 tokens and native assets. Spork shines best with frontend web3 applications where a variety of tokens are necessary for properly testing UI/UX interactions.
